Prosjekt 4


    

All guides and cookbooks have at least these core files. Each file has a distinct purpose and evolves independently as the application grows.

Files outside src/ concern building, deploying, and testing your app. They include configuration files and external dependencies.

Files inside src/ "belong" to your app. Add new Typescript, HTML and CSS files inside the src/ directory, most of them inside src/app, unless told to do otherwise.
